I am currently in the process of constructing an oAuth 2.0 module. I received an email from an individual about continuing this project and know plain-text passwords and a depreciated authentication process are no good for security. Updates on the way. If you would like to assist with this project please contact me.

# UPDATE: 2/24/2013 #
> PAM Works with google authentication.
Google Apps works in-house, but is not uploaded yet.

# Initial tests... #
> will be done with Google's oAuth on a Linux box who's user session and home folder will be heavily modified to allow encrypted storage in sub folders as well as mount Google docs and present one's eMail. The details of this box are not important, and when the final product is released The user will have several options to choose from, for example:

Google Account, no local storage
Google Account, personal home directory
Google Apps, Any User Workstation(no local storage)
Google Apps, Personal Workstation/Laptop(personal home directory)

The purpose of this would be for logging into a Linux box with your Google Credentials.
